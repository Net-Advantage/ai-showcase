# Agent Model Allocation

| Sub-agent                                               | Best default model    | Why this model fits best                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Product Owner (Orchestrator)                            | **Claude Sonnet 4.5** | Copilot explicitly positions Sonnet 4.5 as strong for “general-purpose coding and agent tasks,” which matches orchestration, delegation, and keeping multi-threaded work coherent. ([GitHub Docs][1])                                                              |
| Domain Expert                                           | **Claude Opus 4.6**   | Domain extraction from specs benefits from maximum reasoning quality and careful synthesis. Copilot lists Opus 4.6 as Anthropic’s most powerful option for complex problem-solving. ([GitHub Docs][1])                                                             |
| Task Planner                                            | **Gemini 2.5 Pro**    | Planning is structured reasoning across many constraints and dependencies. Copilot recommends Gemini 2.5 Pro for complex reasoning, debugging, and research-like workflows, which aligns with producing robust plans and traceability matrices. ([GitHub Docs][1]) |
| Architect                                               | **GPT-5.2**           | Architecture work needs deep reasoning, trade-off evaluation, and multi-step analysis. Copilot recommends GPT-5.2 for complex reasoning and technical decision-making. ([GitHub Docs][1])                                                                          |
| UX Designer (Design system, no code)                    | **GPT-4.1**           | This role is heavy on clear writing, systematisation (tokens, components, states), and consistency. Copilot positions GPT-4.1 as strong for general-purpose coding and writing with fast, accurate explanations. ([GitHub Docs][1])                                |
| Frontend Developer (Blazor, MVVM, CSS)                  | **GPT-5.1-Codex**     | Frontend implementation is lots of “ship code” work: components, refactors, wiring, and fixes. Copilot recommends GPT-5.1-Codex for higher-quality code on complex engineering tasks like features, tests, debugging, and refactors. ([GitHub Docs][1])            |
| Backend Developer (.NET, ASP.NET, EF Core, SQL, Aspire) | **GPT-5.1-Codex**     | Same reasoning as frontend, plus more multi-file changes (API, EF mappings, migrations, Aspire wiring). GPT-5.1-Codex is explicitly recommended for complex engineering tasks across features and debugging. ([GitHub Docs][1])                                    |
| Quality Assurance (scenarios, permutations, Playwright) | **Gemini 3 Pro**      | QA needs deep reasoning over permutations and observable behaviour, plus solid automation output. Copilot positions Gemini 3 Pro for complex reasoning and research-like workflows, which fits scenario design and permutation coverage. ([GitHub Docs][1])        |
| Implementation Engineer (docs in `/docs`)               | **GPT-5 mini**        | Docs benefit from fast, accurate writing and structured output without “overthinking.” Copilot recommends GPT-5 mini as a reliable default for coding and writing tasks. ([GitHub Docs][1])                                                                        |
