# Site Style Specification
This spec describes the desired visual style and user experience inspiration for the product’s public-facing website and UI. This serves as the style reference that the UX Designer should interpret into a design system.

## 1. Inspiration References
- **Primary visual inspiration:** https://aspire.dev/ — clean, developer-focused, professional UI
- **Secondary structural inspiration:** https://getbootstrap.com/ — well-spaced modular sections, clear typography, and utility-based layout

### Reference Notes
- The style should feel **clean, modular, and professional**.
- Layout and spacing should follow **clear grids and consistent rhythm**.
- Visual simplicity should support content clarity.

---

## 2. Brand Characteristics
**Brand Tone**
- Modern technical professionalism  
- Developer-centric clarity  
- Calm and trustworthy presentation  

**Personality Keywords**
- focused
- clean
- modular
- technical
- approachable

**Target Perception**
Users should feel confident, capable, and unencumbered when using the UI.

*UX Designer should translate these adjectives into a consistent visual system.*

---

## 3. Layout and Composition

### Global Layout Principles
- **Clear whitespace** and generous padding between sections (inspired by Bootstrap spacing utilities)
- **Modular sections:** visually distinct content blocks
- **Readable content width:** limited line length for text
- **Consistent vertical rhythm:** scaled spacing between elements
- **Responsive grid:** mobile → tablet → desktop breakpoints

### Page Flow
- Hero section with a strong headline and primary call-to-action
- Supporting feature or value blocks
- Secondary calls-to-action
- Footer with navigation, legal, and social links

UX Designer should produce wireframes that reflect clear sections and scalable layouts.

---

## 4. Colour Direction

### Base Palette
- **Background:** light neutral (soft off-white)
- **Primary text:** solid dark neutral
- **Subheading text:** medium neutral
- **Block backgrounds:** very light neutrals for section separation

### Accent Palette
- **Primary accent:** calm developer-friendly colour
- **Secondary accent:** supportive neutral accents for highlights

### Usage Notes
- Colours must support **visual hierarchy** (headings, body text, CTAs)
- Backgrounds should subtly differentiate content groups

*Specific hex values to be defined by UX Designer.*

---

## 5. Typography Direction

### Typeface Style
- Sans-serif font family emphasizing legibility
- Clean modern letterforms
- Clear hierarchy between headings and body

### Hierarchy
- **Large headings** for section titles
- **Medium subheadings** for feature titles
- **Body text** readable at standard sizes with generous line spacing

Bootstrap’s typography utility conventions can serve as a reference point.

---

## 6. Component Feel

### Buttons and CTAs
- Primary and secondary button styles
- Clear states (default, hover, focus, disabled)
- Simple, functional shapes
- Utility-inspired spacing (like Bootstrap’s buttons)

### Navbars and Headers
- Fixed top navigation
- Clear links with visual focus states
- CTA emphasised on primary button

### Content Blocks
- Cards or panels with subtle separation
- Consistent padding and gutters
- Grid or flex-based alignment

UX Designer should formalise these into a design component catalog.

---

## 7. Interaction and Motion
- Subtle transitions on interactive elements (hover, focus)
- Immediate feedback for actions (loading spinners, button states)
- Motion should be minimal and purposeful

---

## 8. Accessibility Expectations
- Minimum contrast ratios meeting WCAG AA
- Logical tab order
- Focus states visible on all interactive elements
- Text sizes responsive and accessible

---

## 9. Responsive Behaviour
- Navigation collapses gracefully on mobile
- Content tanks cleanly on narrower screens
- Spacing utility patterns scale at breakpoints

UX Designer to define breakpoints and responsive adjustments.

---

## 10. Handoff Guidance

This spec should be used by the UX Designer to produce:

- Design tokens (colours, typography, spacing)
- Layout and grid definitions
- Component definitions (buttons, forms, cards, navigation)
- Interaction states for all components

All decisions must be traceable back to this spec.
